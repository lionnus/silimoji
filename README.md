# silimoji

A silicon-flavored emoji guide for hardware development commits.

`silimoji` is a curated Gitmoji-inspired guide for RTL, verification, timing closure, PPA, Python tooling, scripts, CI, infrastructure, dependencies, and normal Git workflow.

It preserves standard Gitmoji meanings and adds hardware-specific entries for critical-path cuts, CDC, backpressure, datapaths, arbitration, PPA, debug visibility, board bring-up, and IP/tool updates.

## Why?

Hardware commits often describe intent that normal software-focused commit emojis do not capture well:

- cutting a critical path
- fixing CDC
- propagating backpressure
- reducing area
- reducing power
- adding probes or waveform visibility
- updating included IPs
- changing RTL interfaces
- improving simulation and synthesis scripts

`silimoji` gives those changes a compact visual language.

## Commit format

```text
<intention> [scope?]: <message>
```

Examples:

```text
:scissors: execute: split multiplier bypass path
:bridge_at_night: uart: synchronize rx_valid into core clock
:rightwards_pushing_hand: axi: propagate downstream backpressure
:chart_with_downwards_trend: decode: share immediate extraction logic
```
